# excel_beast

a gem that aims to provide an even simpler way to generate excel files than writeexcel.
beast_excel is probably not what you're looking for if you want to achieve more advanced stuff
like using excel formulas, charts etc.

but if you have some (text) data you want to export to excel, try it.

## Usage

see documentation (or specs).

## Contributing to excel_beast
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
